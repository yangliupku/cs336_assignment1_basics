            "They took the pot to their room and put it on the floor. They opened their box of crayons, stickers, and glitter. They started to draw and stick and sprinkle on the pot. They made colorful shapes and patterns. They thought the pot looked very nice.\n",

            "Lily and Tom nodded. They hugged Mom and said, \"We will, Mom. We will.\" They took a broom, a dustpan, and a cloth. They started to clean up their mess. They hoped Mom would forgive them. They learned their lesson. They would not decorate Mom's pot again.\n",

            "When he had finished soaking and stepped out of the bathtub, the king noticed that the water had spilled out of the tub and all over the floor. He felt guilty that he had made such a mess, so he quickly grabbed a cloth and began to clean it up.\n",
